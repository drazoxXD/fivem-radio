# FiveM Radio

This resource allows you to integrate your own radios in place of the original radios.
It's fully written in JavaScript and uses resource metadata for its configuration.

## Rewritten by Drazox
This was a small request from my friend, and I wanted to release this because the old js version was using 0.25ms resmon!

My Resource Monitor is at 0.0ms while in use!
Have fun using this hot garbage!

(No offense to the original creator; the idea was good and it was working, but Resource Monitor is not reasonable!)
